 The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with
 objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. In simple words,
 a client consuming the superclass/interface shouldnâ€™t care about the underneath 
 concrete implementation. In fact, the client should not even know about it.
 Basically, rather than worrying about the structure of the class, 
 the principle says to enforce a specific behavior to it.
